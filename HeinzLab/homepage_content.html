<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditory Neurophysiology and Modeling Lab coordinates the use of neurophysiology, psychoacoustics, and computational modeling to extend our understanding of the different types of neural and perceptual hearing loss. By using a multidisciplinary approach, we are able to focus our lens to various depths of auditory perception and hearing science&mdash; essentially anywhere from the cochlea and auditory periphery all the way to the central nervous system. We are currently working on understanding the basic science behind neural coding and behavior, while also investigating translational approaches to Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL) and audiological diagnostics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;Our research team is diverse; in addition to Auditory Neurophysiology our lab members have training in engineering, audiology, animal sciences, biology, medicine, and even music. The knowledge derived for our work has been and continues to be useful in evaluating the limitations of current hearing aids, and for suggesting novel strategies for hearing aids and cochlear implants. At Purdue, our lab collaborates extensively with the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/SNAPLab" style="text-decoration:none">Systems Neuroscience of Auditory Perception Laboratory</a> , <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/slhs/index.html" style="text-decoration:none">Speech Language, &amp; Hearing Sciences</a>, the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME" style="text-decoration:none"> Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering</a>, and <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/institute-for-integrative-neuroscience/" style="text-decoration:none"> Purdue Institute for Integrative Neuroscience</a>. We also collaborate with many labs outside Purdue.</p>
