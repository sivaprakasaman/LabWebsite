		Our research program aims to understand the effects of different types of hearing loss on neural and perceptual responses to sound, translating our findings to create and improve clinically-relevant diagnostics and rehabilitative strategies to help people with various types of hearing loss. Our multi-disciplinary approach involves furthering our understanding of the basic pathophysiology behind hearing loss through neural coding and behavioral studies, while identifying animal models of clinical conditions and diagnostic tools to comprehensively assess hearing.
