		normal and impaired auditory health.</span></p>
<p>
	The overarching goals of our research are to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Understand the neural processes underlying perception of sounds from simple stimuli such as tones to complex stimuli such as speech and music</li>
	<li>
		Understand the anatomical and physiological factors that contribute to perceptual deficits experienced by hearing impaired listeners</li>
	<li>
		Identify noninvasive neurophysiological biomarkers for translating findings from animal models to humans and improve clinical diagnostics</li>
</ul>

		understand human hearing loss, and have accomplished this using a multidisciplinary approach with our experts in:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Animal and human behavioral experiments</li>
	<li>
		Invasive neuronal recordings from deep brain structures</li>
	<li>
		Noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) and ear-canal recordings</li>
	<li>
		Anatomical Labeling</li>
	<li>
		Computational Modeling</li>
</ul>

		other labs in SLHS and the MD Steer Audiology Clinic at Purdue, allow us to coordinate animal and human studies that synergistically bridge the gap between the anatomical, physiological, and perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing
		loss.</span></p>
