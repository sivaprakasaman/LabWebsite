	Histological studies in multiple species, including post-mortem human studies, have shown that acoustic overexposure and normal aging can lead to the loss of afferent synapses innervating the cochlea. Insidiously, this &ldquo;cochlear synaptopathy&rdquo; (CS) can occur without any measurable changes in audiometric thresholds and hence can be &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; from standard clinical diagnostics. Hypothetically, CS, while hidden, can lead to speechunderstanding deficits in noisy environments, and reduced ability to perceive subtle spectrotemporal features of suprathreshold sounds. To test this hypothesis comprehensively in behaving humans and animals, and to aid in the clinical diagnosis of CS, non-invasive assays of CS need to be established.</p>
<p>
	Here, through parallel experiments in at-risk humans and noise-exposed chinchillas, we evaluate a common battery consisting of three physiological measures implemented using shared software tools -- auditory brainstem responses (ABR), wideband middle-ear muscle reflexes (WBMEMR), and swept-tone distortionproduct otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE).</p>
<p>
	Each chinchilla will be exposed to moderate-level octave-band noise for two hours to produce CS and a temporary threshold shift (TTS), while not producing appreciable permanent threshold changes. Measurements will be gathered prior to noise exposure, one day after exposure to confirm TTS, and two weeks after exposure to assay for CS. The same physiological measures will be acquired in a cross-sectional design across young humans reporting regular and substantial acoustic exposure, middle-aged individuals, and young &ldquo;control&rdquo; subjects with nominal acoustic exposures. Preliminary results in both species suggest that suprathreshold ABR wave-I amplitudes, MEMR amplitudes, and MEMR thresholds are correlated with CS risk. DPOAE measures help to control for variations in threshold sensitivity.</p>
<p>
	Future experiments will compare these non-invasive assays to perceptual measures of temporal processing in both species and speech-in-noise measures in humans. Direct measurements of CS using immunohistochemistry will also ultimately be compared to the results from our non-invasive battery in chinchillas.</p>

	Dissecting sensorineural hearing loss: Heightened neural-encoding deficits from a preventable etiology</h3>

	Speech intelligibility can vary dramatically between individuals with hearing loss of similar degree. These perceptual differences, despite equal audiometric-threshold elevation, are often assumed to reflect central-processing variations rather than differences in peripheral neural coding. Here, we characterized peripheral-processing differences between the two most common forms of cochlear dysfunction: metabolic hearing loss (MHL, a model of age-related loss) and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). System-identification analyses of single auditory-nerve (AN) fiber responses revealed that even mild NIHL caused grossly abnormal coding of low-frequency stimulus components. In contrast, for MHL the same abnormal coding was only observed with moderate-severe loss. For equal sensitivity loss, coding impairment was greater with NIHL than MHL. Differences in peripheral coding between these two cochlear pathologies ─ the more severe of which is preventable ─ likely contribute to individual speech-perception differences. Our results underscore the need for strategies to personalize diagnosis and treatment for individuals with sensorineural hearing loss.</p>

	The effects of cochlear synaptopathy on chinchilla amplitude-modulation detection thresholds</h3>

<p>
	Recent animal studies suggest that moderate-level noise exposure can create permanent cochlear synaptopathy despite not permanently damaging hair cells or elevating hearing thresholds in quiet. This hidden hearing loss has been hypothesized to underlie the difficulties some listeners with normal audiograms have in noisy situations. However, it is difficult to test this hypothesis directly because of the inability to measure cochlear synaptopathy directly in humans and the fact that synaptopathy has mainly been shown in rodent models for which behavioral measures at speech frequencies are difficult. We recently established a relevant mammalian behavioral model by showing that chinchillas have corresponding neural and behavioral amplitude-modulation (AM) detection thresholds that are in line with human thresholds. Furthermore, we have shown that cochlear synaptopathy occurs at speech frequencies in chinchillas following moderate noise exposure. In the present study, behavioral AM-detection thresholds were measured in chinchillas, before and after noise exposure, using the method of constant stimuli. Animals were trained to discriminate a sinusoidal AM (SAM) tone from a pure tone, in the presence of a notched-noise masker designed to limit off-frequency listening. Successfully trained animals were tested at a range of AM depths (3-dB steps between -30 and 0 dB), for a range of modulation frequencies. Within a signal-detection-theoretic framework, psychometric AM-detection thresholds were computed as a function of modulation frequency. Behavioral thresholds before noise exposure were in the range of -15 to -26 dB, and were consistent across individual animals. Following synaptopathy-inducing noise exposure, amplitude-modulation detection for SAM tones was not significantly degraded. The low behavioral AM-detection thresholds found here contrast with previous work on other mammalian species (e.g., rabbits, gerbils). Our data are more in line with AM-detection thresholds found in avian species (e.g., budgerigars) and in humans. The lack of an observed deficit in performance in chinchillas with confirmed synaptopathy suggests that amplitude-modulation detection for high-level SAM tones in notched noise may not be sensitive enough for the diagnosis of cochlear synaptopathy. More complex tasks that provide a greater challenge to population neural coding are likely to be required.</p>

	Effects of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss on Speech-In-Noise Envelope Coding</h3>
<h4>

<p>
	Speech-intelligibility (SI) models aim to predict human perceptual performance when speech is subjected to a range of acoustic manipulations. SI models not only test our understanding of how the brain processes speech, but can also assess hearing-aid and cochlear-implant signal-processing strategies. To date, a single SI model that can explain all of the normal-hearing effects of the wide range of tested manipulations remains elusive. Furthermore, even state-of-the-art strategies for hearing aids continue to struggle in adverse backgrounds. These problems highlight two key gaps. Firstly, most SI models are implemented in the audio domain and rely on numerous assumptions. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of published neural data to evaluate these model assumptions. Secondly, it&rsquo;s not straightforward for audio-domain SI models to predict the effects of hearing impairment (beyond audibility). This gap is primarily due to our limited understanding of the variety of effects of cochlear hearing impairment on speech (especially speech-in-noise) coding. For example, two subjects with similar audiograms can have very different speech-understanding ability. Animal models of cochlear hearing impairment provide a useful opportunity to collect data to directly address these SI-model gaps. Here, we collected spike trains from auditory-nerve fibers in anesthetized chinchillas in response to speech, spectrallymatched stationary-noise, and noisy-speech mixtures at perceptually relevant SNRs (-10, -5 and 0 dB). Overall speech intensity was fixed at ~65 dB SPL for normal-hearing and ~80 dB SPL for hearing-impaired animals. Peristimulus-time histograms constructed from spike trains were filtered to extract response envelopes in different modulation bands. Preliminary data reveal that the correlation between AN-fiber response envelopes of noisy-speech and noise-alone is increased for hearing-impaired fibers, suggesting a greater potential degree of distraction from inherent envelope fluctuations following cochlear hearing loss. This novel finding is significant given the emphasis recent SI models (e. g. , J&oslash;rgensen and Dau, JASA 2011) have placed on the importance of inherent envelope fluctuations in predicting noisy-speech perception. In addition, fundamentalperiodicity coding of clean speech was enhanced for the hearing-impaired group, at the expense of placespecific formant coding. Preliminary data also show a degradation of burst envelopes of high-frequency fricatives. These results highlight significant effects of cochlear hearing loss on the strength of inherent noise fluctuations in noisy speech, which are likely to be important in addition to speech-coding fidelity when predicting hearing-impaired SI.</p>

	Neurophysiological Validation of Envelope-based Models of Speech Intelligibility</h3>
<h4>

<p>
	Models of speech intelligibility that accurately reflect human listening performance across a broad range of background noise conditions are important both clinically (e. g. , for deriving hearing-aid prescriptions, and optimizing cochlear-implant signal processing), and for evaluating speech-processing algorithms in technological applications (e. g. , in mobile phones). Envelope-coding based models of speech intelligibility in noise have been widely successful (e. g. , J&oslash;rgensen &amp; Dau, JASA 2011; 2013). However, these acoustic models have not been validated neurophysiologically. Here, using electroencephalography (EEG), we derived a neural metric of envelope coding (ENVneural) of speech in noise to evaluate whether neural envelope coding can predict speech intelligibility. A crucial test of envelope-based models is whether a mapping between ENVneural and perceptual intelligibility derived from one type of background noise can be used to predict intelligibility from just the ENVneural metric for other novel background-noise conditions and linear and nonlinear distortions applied to the input sounds.</p>
<p>
	Subjects performed a speech-identification task using sentences in the IEEE Harvard corpus in a background of speech-shaped (stationary) noise (SSN) presented at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The SNRs were varied to span the full range of speech intelligibility (i. e. , 0 - 100%). Simultaneously, thirty-two-channel EEG data were collected. The spectral phase-locking value (PLV) was calculated between the EEG data and the speech envelopes at the output of ten gammatone filters simulating cochlear frequency selectivity. The PLV values from different EEG channels and across different cochlear gammatone filters were thresholded and combined to yield a single ENVneural value for each listening condition. Preliminary results show a robust monotonic relationship between ENVneural and intelligibility for different SNRs of the SSN background condition, allowing a mapping to be created between ENVneural and intelligibility. To test whether ENVneural can be used with this mapping to predict intelligibility in novel but realistic listening conditions, subjects also performed speech-identification tasks: (1) in a background of 4-talker babble, (2) with babble and extensive room reverberation (linear distortion), and (3) with babble denoised through a binary-masking-based procedure (a nonlinear strategy often used in technological applications). Preliminary data show that intelligibility varies across these novel conditions. Whether these perceptual variations in speech intelligibility can be predicted from ENVneural using the mapping from the stationary noise condition will be evaluated and discussed.</p>

<h3>
	Both inner and outer hair-cell dysfunction degrade neural coding of perceptually relevant complex sounds</h3>
<h4>

<p>
	Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) disrupts the quality of life of millions of people around the world. The clinical category of SNHL is a catchall that includes several types of cochlear damage that can result from different causes (e.g., noise overexposure, chemical ototoxicity, aging). Two patients with similar degrees and configurations of SNHL (i.e., audiograms) can have significantly different speech intelligibility. This common clinical outcome illustrates the need for additional diagnostic measures, which will require a more detailed understanding of the variety of mechanistic changes that can occur following SNHL.</p>
<p>
	The goal of this work was to investigate several underlying mechanisms of SNHL by selectively perturbing individual components of the peripheral auditory system, specifically the inner (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs). This was accomplished by measuring both invasive single-unit and non-invasive evoked neural responses in chinchillas that were administered ototoxic drugs chosen for their hair-cell specificity (gentamicin &ndash; OHCs; carboplatin &ndash; IHCs). Single auditory-nerve-fiber (ANF) responses were measured to stimuli ranging from simple tones to more complex sounds, including amplitude- and frequency-modulated tones and broadband noise, which represent fundamental acoustic features of speech and music in real-world environments. This experimental approach made it possible to measure the isolated effects of damage to each cell type on peripheral neural processing (i.e., without confounding interactions of damage to other peripheral components that often occur with noise over-exposure or age). Light microscopy was used to quantify IHC and OHC loss and scanning electron microscopy illustrated that remaining IHCs can have disrupted stereocilia that appear to limit their functional efficiency.</p>
<p>
	Changes in distortion-product otoacoustic emissions were predictive of several well-known physiological effects of OHC dysfunction, including loss of peripheral frequency selectivity. Physiologically, IHC dysfunction produced subtle or no effects on common threshold measurements, but perceptually relevant effects were predicted from neural responses to suprathreshold sounds. Our results suggest that frequency-modulated tones may be effective stimuli for IHC diagnostics.</p>
<p>
	While IHC damage has long been viewed primarily in terms of cochlear dead regions (i.e., missing IHCs), our physiological and anatomical evidence suggests that even remaining functional IHCs may produce degraded ANF responses that provide less neural information for the perception of complex sounds, but do not affect thresholds in a major way. Thus, IHC dysfunction appears to be an important factor to consider in cases of hidden (or mild) hearing loss.</p>

	Effects of cochlear-synaptopathy inducing moderate noise exposure on auditory-nerve-fiber responses in chinchillas</h3>
<h4>

<p>
	It has been hypothesized that selective loss of low-spontaneous-rate (low-SR) auditory-nerve (AN) fibers following moderate noise exposure may underlie perceptual difficulties some people experience in noisy situations, despite normal audiograms. However, the finding of selective low-SR-fiber loss hasn&rsquo;t been replicated in an animal model with behavioral thresholds similar to humans. We recently established a behavioral chinchilla model for which neural and behavioral AM-detection thresholds are in line with each other and similar to humans. Here, we report physiological AN-fiber response properties from anesthetized chinchillas exposed to noise that produced cochlear synaptopathy, as confirmed by immunofluorescence histology. Auditory-brainstem responses, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions, and compound action potentials confirmed no significant permanent threshold shift. Stimuli included both simple (pure tones, as studied previously) and complex (broadband noise) sounds. Low-SR fibers were reduced in percentage (but not eliminated) following noise exposure, as shown previously in guinea pigs. Saturated rates to tones were reduced. Similar tuning and temporal coding were observed in broadband-noise responses following noise exposure. Complete characterization of AN-fiber responses to complex sounds in a mammalian behavioral model of noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy will be useful for understanding suprathreshold deficits that may occur due to hidden hearing loss.</p>
