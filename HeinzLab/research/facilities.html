	<u>Neurophysiology Laboratory (LYLE 3035, 3037, 3089; all rooms connected): </u></p>
<p>
	Two fully equipped neurophysiology setups exist within the lab and are available for this project, all under the direction of Michael G. Heinz (PI).&nbsp; Both setups are virtually identical, and are used for minimally invasive measures of auditory function (MEMR/OAE/ABR/EFR/EEG) and for single-unit auditory-nerve experiments. Each setup includes a double-walled sound-attenuating chamber, surgical microscope, blood-oxygen monitor and oxygen supply, homeothermic blanket system, Kopf stereotaxic head holder, DPOAE probe system with insert earphones, electrode manipulators and hydraulic micro-drive, ear bars, closed-field speakers, a probe-tube calibration microphone. Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) System 3 hardware is integrated with a National Instruments D/A board to present the acoustic stimuli and synchronization timing pulses. A cellular preamplifier and conditioning filter is used with a time-amplitude window discriminator to detect spikes and discriminate them from background noise. A National Instruments counter board is used to time precisely all detected neural spikes. Custom MATLAB software is used for stimulus generation, stimulus presentation, and data collection interfacing with the TDT equipment and NI boards. A third TDT System-3 controls a custom sound exposure box (roughly 4&rsquo;x3&rsquo;x4&rsquo; in size, modeled after the cochlear synaptopathy exposure box used by Charlie Liberman in the Eaton-Peabody Lab in Boston), which sits within the 3rd double-walled sound-attenuating booth within the lab. Also, a vented fume hood and tools for histological fixation and cochlear extraction and micro-dissection are also available with the lab (connected room 3089). An electrode fabrication setup is also contained within the lab, including a glass microforge and electrode etching equipment.</p>

	<u>Chinchilla Behavioral Lab (LSA B14A):</u></p>
<p>
	Two fully functional operant-conditioning setups are housed within a larger single-walled IAC sound booth adjacent to our animal-housing room within LSA.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<u>Histological and Imaging Lab (LYLE 3024):</u></p>
<p>
	A renovated wet-lab (~$500k investment in shared histology/microscopy facilities for SLHS, supported by the Provost&rsquo;s office, and SLHS Dept., and individual PIs) exists for histological fixation, cochlear extraction and micro-dissection, and brain-tissue processing. This room contains an ultra-pure water system, a sub-80 freezer, a Leica sliding microtome, a Zeiss AxioImager M2 imaging system with dedicated PC workstations for image collection and analysis.</p>

	<u>Shared Imaging Facilities at Purdue:</u></p>
<p>
	Our lab also utilizes several shared microscopy facilities at Purdue, including confocal microscopes, scanning electron microscopes, and transmission electron microscopes.</p>
<p>

<p>
	<u>Animal Care</u></p>
<p>
	The Purdue University Laboratory Animal Program (LAP) provides fully accredited (AAALAC-I) animal housing and veterinary-care facilities. Central animal housing facilities (LSA building) provide regular feeding, care, and cage cleaning for the chinchillas.&nbsp; LAP provides assistance for training new laboratory staff in approved animal care procedures. The Purdue Animal Care and Use Committee (PACUC) reviews animal care and use protocols, assures animal care and use is performed in accordance with protocols, and provides training for maintaining and documenting regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<u>Computers</u></p>
<p>
	The physiology and behavioral experimental setups each contain a computer to run the custom software and to control the hardware. Data acquisition and analysis is typically done in MATLAB. Each lab member has a PC other than the experimental computer for offline data analysis and writing, with several high-end computational PCs for advanced analyses and modeling. Purdue also provides extensive computer facilities and support across campus.</p>

<p>
	<u>Office</u>:</p>
<p>
	Separate office space for lab members (e.g., PI, Behavioral Lab Animal Tech, Post-Doctoral Fellows, graduate students) is located in rooms adjacent or nearby to the neurophysiological experimental lab space within Lyles-Porter Hall. Our lab and offices are on the same floor as Hari Bharadwaj&rsquo;s lab and office and Profs. Simpson&rsquo;s offices, and are upstairs from the Purdue M.D. Steer Audiology Clinic.</p>
