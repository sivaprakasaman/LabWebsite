	The Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences has an electronics shop with two full-time engineers who provide support for research and clinical activities in the department.&nbsp; They are available to our Clinic immediately upon request. The SLHS shop is located on the same floor and adjacent to our labs in LYLE. Extensive support is also available to both our labs through the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering (located in Martin Jischke Hall, a 5-min walk from Lyles-Porter Hall), including Veterinary Lab Technicians, mechanical and electrical engineering support, remote server space and clusters for computational modeling, and a fully functional machine shop complete with two industrial CNC mills.</p>

	Two secretaries work for the Clinic.&nbsp; They schedule patients, greet and check out patients, take payments, and communicate with the audiologists regarding schedules and patient needs. Part of their responsibility is to maintain the Department&rsquo;s Research Registry.</p>

	The intellectual environment at Purdue is open and supportive. Members from the large community of hearing researchers including students and post-docs spread across multiple departments organize a weekly Hearing Research Seminar (coordinated by co-PI Hari Bharadwaj). This promotes collaboration within Purdue, and provides the opportunity to invite leading experts in the field from across the country and internationally. In addition, a new Purdue Institute for Integrative Neuroscience brings together around 100 faculty members from 25 departments and 6 colleges with broad interests in neuroscience. Thus, Purdue provides an environment that is highly enriching to train students and post-docs and to get access to experts using a wide range of techniques to study the brain. In addition, the numerous engineering departments, including the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering (where both Profs. Bharadwaj and Heinz have joint appointments), and the interdisciplinary Purdue Discovery Park provide a nurturing environment to translate research findings and maximize practical impact.</p>
