	<span style="font-size: 12px;">The intellectual environment at Purdue is open and supportive. Members from the large community of hearing researchers including students and post-docs spread across multiple departments organize a weekly Hearing Research Seminar (coordinated by Hari Bharadwaj). This promotes collaboration within Purdue, and provides the opportunity to invite leading experts in the field from across the country and internationally. In addition, a new Purdue Institute for Integrative Neuroscience brings together around 100 faculty members from 25 departments and 6 colleges with broad interests in neuroscience. Thus, Purdue provides an environment that is highly enriching to train students and post-docs and to get access to experts using a wide range of techniques to study the brain. In addition, the numerous engineering departments, including the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering (where Prof. Heinz has a joint appointment), and the interdisciplinary Purdue Discovery Park provide a nurturing environment to translate research findings and maximize practical impact.</span></p>
