				<td> Michael G. Heinz is a Professor of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences and of Biomedical Engineering. Mike is a native of Baltimore, MD and grew up sailing on the Chesapeake Bay. He received an Sc.B. degree in Electrical Engineering from Brown University in 1992. He then completed a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in 1994, where he performed psychoacoustical experiments measuring the ability of human listeners to detect signals in noise. In 2000, he received a Ph.D. from the MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology in the area of Speech and Hearing Sciences. His dissertation involved computational and theoretical modeling to quantify the amount of information in auditory-nerve responses for psychoacoustical tasks. His post-doctoral work was in Biomedical Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where his work evaluated possible neural correlates of loudness recruitment by comparing neurophysiological responses from single auditory-nerve fibers in animals with normal hearing and noise-induced hearing loss. 


				<p>In 2005, he joined the faculty at Purdue as an Assistant Professor, where he and his lab members have been investigating the relation between neurophysiological and perceptual responses to sound with normal and impaired hearing through the coordinated use of neurophysiology, computational modeling, and psychoacoustics. He teaches courses in both SLHS and BME. In 2010, he was elected a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA), and served as Chair of the ASA Technical Committee on Psychological and Physiological Acoustics from 2011-2014. In 2013, he received the Early Career Research Award from the College of Health and Human Sciences, and in 2016 he was chosen as a University Faculty Scholar. He currently serves as the Co-Director of an NIH-funded (T32) Interdisciplinary Training Program in Auditory Neuroscience, and serves as the Director of Graduate Programs in BME. He also serves as an Associate Editor for the Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology (JARO).

				<td> François is a postdoctoral fellow with a 2-year grant from the <a href = "https://www.fondationpourlaudition.org/en/research/research-121"> Fondation pour l’Audition</a>. He received his engineering degree and MSc in Applied Mathematics from the Ecole polytechnique, France. In 2019, he completed his PhD in computational neuroscience at the EHESS, Paris, on the efficient coding of speech, looking for relationships between the statistics of speech and properties of cochlear signal processing. He developed an interest in understanding the role of cochlear nonlinearities, affecting in particular the frequency selectivity of the inner ear, in normal hearing. His current work focuses on the use of ECochG signals (electrocochleography) with forward masking settings to estimate fundamental properties of the inner ear in a non-invasive manner.
