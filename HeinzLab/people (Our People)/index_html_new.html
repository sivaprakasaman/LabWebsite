				<td> Michael G. Heinz is a Professor of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences and of Biomedical Engineering. Mike is a native of Baltimore, MD and grew up sailing on the Chesapeake Bay. He received an Sc.B. degree in Electrical Engineering from Brown University in 1992. He then completed a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in 1994, where he performed psychoacoustical experiments measuring the ability of human listeners to detect signals in noise. In 2000, he received a Ph.D. from the MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology in the area of Speech and Hearing Sciences. His dissertation involved computational and theoretical modeling to quantify the amount of information in auditory-nerve responses for psychoacoustical tasks. His post-doctoral work was in Biomedical Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where his work evaluated possible neural correlates of loudness recruitment by comparing neurophysiological responses from single auditory-nerve fibers in animals with normal hearing and noise-induced hearing loss. 

				<p></p>

				<p>In 2005, he joined the faculty at Purdue as an Assistant Professor, where he and his lab members have been investigating the relation between neurophysiological and perceptual responses to sound with normal and impaired hearing through the coordinated use of neurophysiology, computational modeling, and psychoacoustics. He teaches courses in both SLHS and BME. In 2010, he was elected a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA), and served as Chair of the ASA Technical Committee on Psychological and Physiological Acoustics from 2011-2014. In 2013, he received the Early Career Research Award from the College of Health and Human Sciences, and in 2016 he was chosen as a University Faculty Scholar. He currently serves as the Co-Director of an NIH-funded (T32) Interdisciplinary Training Program in Auditory Neuroscience, and serves as the Director of Graduate Programs in BME. He also serves as an Associate Editor for the Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology (JARO).

He received his engineering degree and MSc in Applied Mathematics from the Ecole polytechnique, France. In 2019, he completed his PhD in computational neuroscience at the EHESS, Paris, on the efficient coding of speech, looking for relationships between the statistics of speech and properties of cochlear signal processing. He developed an interest in understanding the role of cochlear nonlinearities, affecting in particular the frequency selectivity of the inner ear, in normal hearing. His current work focuses on the use of ECochG signals (electrocochleography) with forward masking settings to estimate fundamental properties of the inner ear in a non-invasive manner.

She went on to obtain her PhD from the University of Cincinnati College of Allied Health Sciences in 2019.  Ivy's dissertation research focused on examining the physiologic phenotype of cochlear synaptopathy using a gerbil-model of music-induced hearing loss. Her research interests include using electrophysiological measures to investigate cortical and subcortical plasticity resulting from people's listening history - with a special interest in how prolonged exposures to music and recreational sounds produce different cognitive and neuroplastic outcomes than do standard occupational and more harsh noises (i.e., traffic noise). Ivy joined Purdue’s Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences in November 2019. To expand her research experiences she is engaged in translational research investigating differences in envelope coding of speech-in-noise for normal hearing and synaptopathic humans and animals as well as those with permanent sensory damage. Ivy works across the labs of both Dr. Michael Heinz and Dr. Hari Bharadwaj.

She is currently pursuing a M.S. in biomedical engineering in the 5th-year combined BS/MS program. While in the lab, Hannah has been involved in investigating three non-invasive diagnostic measures of hidden hearing loss, including the promising middle-ear muscle reflex. She began this work during the summer of 2018 when she was granted a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF). After successfully completing SURF, she continued this work and presented it at the Association of Research in Otolaryngology (ARO) meeting in 2019. For her master’s thesis, Hannah is developing and designing an electrode cap system for chinchillas to be utilized during data collection of auditory brainstem responses, in order to reduce the inherent variability of the current lab procedure. In her time spent outside of the lab, Hannah enjoys leading STEM outreach activities for the Women in Engineering Program. Her hobbies include learning new things, traveling, photography, 3d printing, hammocking, playing soccer, hiking, and any other excuse to spend some time outside! After receiving her master’s degree, Hannah hopes to pursue a career in the medical device industry focused on product development.

She received her B.S. in BME from Purdue University in May 2019, and joined the lab that same month to pursue the M.S. portion of the 5th year program. Caitlin is working on developing noninvasive methods to record electrocochleography measures in chinchillas. These measures include the compound action potential, the summating potential, and the cochlear microphonic. She is also working on creating code that analyzes these measures to try to identify features, such as the amplitude of the compound action potential,  that differentiate between different types of hearing loss. After she completes her master’s degree, Caitlin hopes to work on research and development for a biomedical company. In her spare time, Caitlin enjoys reading, watching shows, playing the cello, knitting and crocheting, and photography.
